## Introduction
JavaScript is the language of the Web. Almost every website these days uses JavaScript and the majority of all web browsers support JavaScript. So, JavaScript is one of the most deployed languages today. The name JavaScript came from Netscape's support of Java applets within the web browser.

With the introduction of NodeJS, JavaScript is now not only limited and dependent on web browsers, but it can also interact with the system hardware and operating system directly allowing JS programs to read and write files, send and receive data over the network, make and create HTTP request, etc.

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language that is well suited for object-oriented programming as well as functional or procedural-oriented programming styles.

To be noted that, although Java and JavaScript sounds correlated but actually they are completely different programming language. The syntax seems to be losely related to each other but JavScript is not striped version of Java.

# Short History
JavaScript was created at Netscape during the evolving days of the Web. The word "JavaScript" was officially a registered trademark under Sun Microsystem (now Oracle) so, when JavaScript was submitted for standardization to ECMA (European Computer Manufacture Association), it was stuck with a weird name ECMAScript, due to which you can see the word "ES" frequently when dealing with JavaScript.

ES5 is supported by every browser available today. ES6 was introduced in 2015, which added major features like class-module syntax and was one of the major reasons behind the huge success of JavaScript. Followed by ES6, the naming convention was broken and the later versions were called ES2016, ES2017, and so on.

## What's Next?
Now, We will be diving into JavaSscript further with some codes and let's brace ourself for the journey.
